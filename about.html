                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p class="text-muted">LINK was founded by high-school students eager to make a difference within the education system. A noticeable flaw we realized was that many high-school students are not necessarily passionate about exploring new knowledge. While advancing through the education system, and especially during the times in high school, students will undoubtedly notice a steady increase in work load. Much of the students become less motivated to accomplish their original goals as they are unable to adhere and adapt to the strenuous workload. We believe this is merely a symptom of a problem that had started way before high-school. The development of work habits and the beginning of hobbies that results in a driven and dedicated attitude towards new knowledge can be traced back to elementary school, where students first encounter formal education. The cause of the problem is simply the actions taken during after-school hours, which can greatly influence a student's success academically and socially. Instead of going home and needlessly devoting hours upon hours to YouTube or video games, LINK encourages students to become more productive. A passion will not only develop effective work habits, but will also provide the students with a reason to seek new knowledge continuously. Through the nurturing of students, we provide the vital first steps into success within and outside of a school atmosphere. The steps to take action and discover something that bears significance to a child. Find a passion.</p>

We are committed to fostering the children’s confidence, and create programs that will promote their intellectual growth and ￼development. They deserve to be given the encouragement and space to try new things, explore new ideas and develop their own unique view.</p>

Most staffs will be volunteers and will usually be high-school students who have a positive and sensitive attitude towards children.
